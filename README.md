# Provola

> Provola, provalo, just test it!

`provola` is your best ~~cheese~~ friend when you need to test code quickly.

Just create an *input* file, an *expected output* file and a program to digest
the input and `provola` will test your program automatically whenever you change
the code.

```shell
# Create a simple haskell program
echo 'main = interact reverse' > reverse.hs

# An input for your nice program
echo -n abcd > in.txt

# The expected output
echo -n dcba > out.txt

# Run provola!
provola -i in.txt -o out.txt -s reverse.hs -w .
```

## Shell auto completion

`provola` provides shell autocompletion for even faster usage.

You can install autocompletion for yout favourite shell:

```shell
provola --shell-compl zsh > ~/.zfunc/_provola
```

Example:

```shell
provola -T GoogleTest -t path/to/gtest/executable
```

This is a (work in progress) list of supported frameworks:

| Framework   | Language |
